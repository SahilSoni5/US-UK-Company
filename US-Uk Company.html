    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A dashboard-style SPA. The top level features key metric cards (Total Companies by country) and primary filters (Country, Sector). The main view is an interactive grid of company cards, which are dynamically updated by the filters. Clicking a card opens a modal with detailed information, including a summary and specific marketing/PR needs, and now turnover. A bar chart visualizes the distribution of companies by sector. This structure was chosen to transform the dense report into an actionable tool, allowing users to quickly identify and drill down into relevant business opportunities rather than reading linearly. The user flow is designed for exploration and discovery. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Key Metrics (Total Companies): Goal: Inform. Method: HTML/CSS cards. Interaction: Updates with filters. Justification: Quick, high-level overview.
        - Company Database: Goal: Organize/Compare. Method: HTML/CSS/JS grid of cards. Interaction: Filters (Country, Sector, Search), click to see details. Justification: The core interactive element for prospect identification.
        - Sector Distribution: Goal: Compare. Method: Chart.js Bar Chart. Interaction: Updates with country filter. Justification: Visualizes sector concentration of opportunities.
        - Company Details: Goal: Inform. Method: JS-powered Modal. Interaction: Open/Close. Justification: Provides deep-dive information without leaving the main dashboard. Now includes turnover data for enhanced context.
        - Market Context: Goal: Inform. Method: HTML/CSS Accordion. Interaction: Expand/Collapse. Justification: Keeps essential background info accessible but unobtrusive.

                                <p class="text-slate-700">India's economy is on a strong growth trajectory, with its GDP exceeding £3 trillion and projected to grow at 5% annually. This economic expansion is creating a massive consumer market, expected to be the world's second-largest by 2030. The burgeoning middle class and rising disposable incomes are fueling demand for global brands, transforming India from a manufacturing hub into a primary consumer market. This shift requires foreign companies to invest heavily in localized brand building and consumer-facing marketing to capture significant market share.</p>

                                <p class="text-slate-700">The India-UK FTA is a landmark deal set to boost bilateral trade by $34 billion. It significantly reduces tariffs on UK products, making them more competitive. Duties on key exports like Scotch whisky will drop from 150% to 40% over time, and luxury car duties will be slashed from over 100% to 10% under a quota system. This creates a highly favorable environment for UK brands in sectors like Food & Drink, Automotive, and Consumer Goods to expand aggressively, supported by increased marketing investment budgets due to lower operational costs.</p>

This challenges companies like Apple, which are pursuing a "China Plus One" strategy to diversify manufacturing and make India a major export hub. Despite tariff headwinds, the strategic imperative to de-risk supply chains from China keeps US investment strong, particularly in electronics manufacturing. US companies must therefore adopt agile PR strategies to manage narratives around supply chain shifts and focus marketing efforts on India's vast domestic market.</p>
